# chess-in-js
This is my first full project ever uploaded to github.

It's a basic chess game made in Javascript vanilla, HTML and Css.

No tutorials were watched to make this project.
All algorithms were made from scratch-
100% original code.

Enjoy playing with another person, you are free to use this code (for non-profitable purposes).
